# LifeLadderPacker
LifeLadderPacker is a solution build for Port Safety and their LifeLadder product - https://port-safety.com/.

In the LifeLadderPacker app you can create LADDERS by telling amount, length and number of light units.  

When you have a list of ladders you can create a SHIPMENT which is a collection of packed pallets.   

The shipment packs the ladders on hafl pallets, called PALLETS. These half pallets are then paired to whole pallets, called EPAL PALLETS. If it is an odd number of half pallets, of cource there will be a single half pallet besides all the whole pallets.  

In the result you can read the layout of the shipment, like where the ladders go on the pallets and data about each pallet like weight and height.
